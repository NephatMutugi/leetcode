## Arrays and strings

### Two pointers

    - It involves having two integer variables that both move along an iterable. 
    This means we will have two integers, usually named something like i and j,
    or left and right which each represent an index of the array or string.
Ways of implementing the algorithm include:
> Start the pointers at the edges of the input. Move them towards each other until they meet.

1. Start one pointer at the first index 0 and the other pointer at the last index input.length - 1.
2. Use a while loop until the pointers are equal to each other.
3. At each iteration of the loop, move the pointers towards each other. This means either increment the pointer that started at the first index, decrement the pointer that started at the last index, or both. Deciding which pointers to move will depend on the problem we are trying to solve.
